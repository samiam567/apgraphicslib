I have reason so believe that you guys will have doubts about whether or not it was actually me that wrote this code. 
-I did NOT use any libraries other than those that come standard with java (ArrayList, JFrame, etc.) to write this engine
-I did NOT copy ANY code from other people. All of this was written from SCRATCH by ME
-I did NOT follow a video or tutorial from anyone and I did not get any help from anyone to write this code
-The only resources ourside my own mind that I used was stuff that came directly out of Prof. Harris's mouth in lecture or from the JavaDocs website

The (only) exception to this is that while I wrote my own working version using Vector3Ds by myself, I used a website to obtain the rotation matrices for 2D and 3D rotation so that I could increase efficiency

Since I know that may be hard to believe, I have included a "Documentation" directory that contains picutes of some of the diagrams and different things that I used to solve some of the problems I encountered while writing the engine.
I will pass any valid test you may devise to check the truthfulness of the above statements.
